				The McKenzie Duo, one of the Chicago area's finest flute and guitar 
				duos, is the musical partnership of husband and wife team of 
				flutist Sue McKenzie and guitarist Mark McKenzie. We have been 
				performing together for over ten years, for weddings ceremonies, 
				banquets, dedications, memorial services, as well as for concert 
				performances. We draw from diverse musical backgrounds, including 
				classical, popular, jazz, traditional and ethnic styles. The warm 
				and versatile blend of flute and guitar is well suited to a wide 
				range of musical styles and periods, from Beethoven to the Beatles, 
				from Medieval dances to today's favorite songs.
