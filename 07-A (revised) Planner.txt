Our first look-what-they've-done-to-by-song is "Sugar and Spice", a song written by
Fred Nightingale. Up first, a version that reached #44 in 1964 by The Searchers,
followed by a version from 1966 by the Cryan' Shames that peaked at #49 but
was a pretty big hit in their hometown Chicago area. 	
 
>>>>>
That was the first half of an Association twin-spin - their big #1 hit from 1967, "Windy"
Here's one that just made the top 40 in 1968, "Time for Livin'".
 
>>>>>
I guess you know you're a big star when you make a Kellogg's commercial. This week we're
taking a look at the Monkees.

	In wake of Beatle mania, NBC TV decided to
	create The Monkees, a show featuring a Made-for-TV band.
	The show was cast with four actors/singers/musicians with varying degrees of
	acting and musical experience.  The four were

	Micky Dolenz (Los Angeles, California, U.S) - prior screen experience 
	(child - Circus Boy) - taught to play drums for the show
		
	Peter Tork (Washington, D.C.) (died feb 2019 age 77)
		proficient musician, multi-instrumentalist(bass, banjo, guitars) - 
		performed at folk clubs contributed to writing/arranging - characteristic wool cap
	Michael Nesmith (Houston TX) (age 73) - previous recording experience, 
	    singer/songwriter, Mother invented Liquid Paper
	Davy Jones (born Lancashire, England) died (age 66 in 2002)- experienced on screen and
		musical stage (Oliver artful dodger)
		Brady Bunch appearance

	Dolenz described the Monkees as initially being "a TV show about an imaginary band ... 
	that wanted to be the Beatles, [but] that was never successful".[1] 
	The actor-musicians, however, soon became a real band.

	the lineup for the TV show most frequently featured Nesmith on guitar, 
	Tork on bass, Dolenz on drums and Jones as a frontman, singer and percussionist. 

	Critics of the Monkees observed that they were simply the "Pre-Fab four", 
	a made-for-TV knockoff of the Beatles; the Beatles, however, took it in their stride 
	and hosted a party for the Monkees when they visited England. 

	have sold more than 75 million records worldwide 
	At their peak in 1967, the band outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined
 	4 of 6 albums reached #1, 12 top forty hits, 3 number one. 

	Here's they come...The Monkees from 1966 with the theme from their TV Show...
	
>>>>>
That was the 2nd of 3 in our artist focus on the Monkees - a pretty one from 1968,
"It's Nice to Be with You". (great hit #67) "Words"

Days of Summer"?

*****07-A 18 Artist Profile Monkees	Six String Mark	2015	0:02	Recorded Live

	In wake of Beatles popularity, NBC TV decided to
	create The Monkees, a show featuring a Made-for-TV band.
	The show was cast with four actors/singers/musicians with varying degrees of
	acting and musical experience.  The four were

	Micky Dolenz (Los Angeles, California, U.S) (age 71) - prior screen experience (child - Circus Boy) - 
		taught to play drums for the show
		
	Peter Tork (Washington, D.C., U.S.) (age 74)
		proficient musician, multi-instrumentalist(bass, banjo, guitars) - performed at folk clubs
		contributed to writing/arranging - characteristic wool cap
	Michael Nesmith (Houston TX) (age 73) - previous recording experience, singer/songwriter
		Mother invented Liquid Paper
	Davy Jones (born Lancashire, England) died (age 66 in 2002)- experienced on screen and
		musical stage (Oliver artful dodger)
		Brady Bunch appearance


	Dolenz described the Monkees as initially being "a TV show about an imaginary band ... 
	that wanted to be the Beatles, [but] that was never successful".[1] 
	The actor-musicians, however, soon became a real band.

	the lineup for the TV show most frequently featured Nesmith on guitar,
