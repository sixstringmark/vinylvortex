Part 1 ===================================================================================
>>>>> Hi, there. Welcome to the Vinyl Vortex Oldies Show ( the best oldies show on the 
internet. here's your host, Six String Mark) Thank you, EB. We're playing the hits of the 
sixties along with vintage sound-bytes blended to create a virtual 60's radio experience.  
This week's show is focused on the music that was on the radio the first of August, 
each year of the Sixties. We've got well over 100 hits in this week's show, including
6 Beatles, 4 Beach Boys, 3 each Association, Elvis, Sam Cooke, and Stevie Wonder 
20 number one, 43 top ten, 32 top forty, and 15 lesser hits. We've got songs about food -
bread and butter, peas, sugar, pie, and honey, and songs about and by a number of 
creatures, including the hummingbird, butterfly, crow, bass, yardbirds, monkees, 
lions, and just plain animals. Let's get the platters spinning with 5 top ten hits:

This week that was is the 1st week of August, 1964. We'll be counting down the top
six from the 40 Star Survey from Radio 70-wonderful, WHB, 710 AM on the dial,
in Kansas City MO.

Back then, WHB was
a 10000 watt Ted Storz station, with the World's Happiest Broadcasters -
Don Armstrong, Jerry Mason, Gene Woody, Ron Martin
Phil Jay, and Ken Knight - 

Gas per Gallon 30 cents 
Loaf of bread 21 cents 
United States Postage Stamp 5 cents 

Events this week: 

In the latest polls - President Lyndon Baines Johnson holds a wide lead, 59% to 31%, 
over Sen. Barry Goldwater in the 1964 Presidential race. 

Race riots erupted in Jersey City NJ

US began bombing North Vietnam

President Johnson’s anti-poverty and food stamp bills cleared Congress. 


Wednesday Night Television -
CBS - CBS News With Walter Cronkite, Beverly Hillbillies, Dick Van Dyke
NBC - Huntley-Brinkley report, The Virginian, Espionage, Eleventh Hour
ABC - Ozzie and Harriet, Patty Duke Show, Farmer’s Daughter,
Ben Casey , 77 Sunset Strip. The Tonight Show with 
Johnny Carson - with Jan Peerce, Robert Merrill

And 1964 had lot's of great music - let's start the countdown...

>>>>>
We're halfway through the top six from the 40 Star Survey from Radio 70-wonderful, WHB, 
in Kansas City, for this week that was is the 1st week of August, 1964. In that set:

#6 "Haunted House" by rockabilly singer Gene Simmons. No, this is not the same Gene Simmons
from the 70s group Kiss, but the Kiss bassist did take his stage name in tribute.

#5 A double number five for the Beach Boys - both sides of the 45 disc -
"Don't Worry Baby" and "I Get Around".

and

#4 The Supremes with "Where Did Our Love Go"

(back)

>>>>>
That completes the top six from the 40 Star Survey from Radio 70-wonderful, WHB, 
in Kansas City, for this week that was is the 1st week of August, 1964. 

#3 Dean Martin with "Everybody Love Somebody" - another one of the songs my dad used to
sing around the house

#2 Dusty Springfield with a great Burt Bacharach & Hal David song - "Wishin' & Hopin'"

and

#1 The Beatles with the title song from their first feature film, "A Hard Day's Night"

(back)

>>>>>
(forgotten 1963) "China Nights" - by Kyu Sakamoto - It didn't do quite as well as his
big #1 hit, "Sukiyaki", peaking at #58

>>>>>
Up next, the last music segment for this week's show - what's that mean EB?
(host favorites)  Yep, 4 of my hand-picked personal favorite 60s hits from the 1st 
week of August. Up first, one of the most romantic of all oldies, the Cryan' Shames
with "It Could Be We're in Love", a song that only hit #85 nationally but was a big, big 
hit in their hometown Chicago area.

>>>>>
2/4 host favorites - The Hollies with "Bus Stop" - from the summer of '66. I remember
walking to the Maijer store in Kalamazoo and buying that 45. (#1 1964) Manfred Mann -
"Do Wah Diddy Diddy", one of the many great songs written by the husband-wife team of
Jeff Barry/Ellie Greenwich.

>>>>>
That was 4/4 host's favorites, and the final song of this week's show - The Marvelettes
with a song that hit #17 in 1962 - "Beachwood 4-5789", and I'm betting that phone number 
is no longer in service. Back then we could make local calls with no area code - just the 
7-digit number. The word provided the first 2 numbers of the phone number, so Beachwood
4-5789 was BE4-5789, which on the rotary dial was 234-5789. A lot more interesting than
just digits - things like Pennsylvania 6-5000, Bakerfield 7-3456, Hempstead 7-4075.

>>>>>
