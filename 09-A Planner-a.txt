	Hi, there. Welcome to the Vinyl Vortex Oldies Show, the best oldies show on the internet.
	I'm your host, Six String Mark, playing the hits of the sixties along with 
	vintage sound-bytes blended to create a virtual 60's radio experience.  This week's
	show is focused on the music that was on the radio the first week of September, each year of

	any commercials, jingles, news/weather/sports, or promotions you 
	hear are vintage radio soundbytes included to provide a virtual sixties radio experience.
