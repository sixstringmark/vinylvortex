This all started when I discovered the <a href="http://las-solanas.com/arsa/index.php">ARSA</a> Top-40 surveys site.  
I grew up
in the sixties listening to top forty radio, mostly the
Chicago market with WLS, WCFL, and WJJD.  The 
<a href="http://las-solanas.com/arsa/index.php">ARSA</a> site had all the 
weekly radio surveys and helped me rediscover the oldies that I loved back then,
and my music collection grew.  I started building playlists in iTunes
for various survey weeks, and over time I had playlists
with at least the top ten songs
for every WLS survey of the sixties.  I then discovered WLS and Dick Biondi
and other sixties radio airchecks on youtube, and started mining for jingles, 
old commercials, and DJ soundbytes.  I mixed the jingles and 
commercials, and some computer speech for dates and such,
into my survey countdown playlists, which gave me
"virtual sixties radio" listening.  Before long, I had added 
playlists for many radio stations across the US and Canada.
</p><p>
This was all great fun for me, listening on my computer and iPod,
and I thought it might be fun to share this "virtual sixties radio" on the web.  
So that gave birth the the Vinyl Vortex Oldies show.
</p><p>
It's about the sixties music (best era ever) primarily, but also the history -
jingles, commercials, and other audio artifacts. Since I wanted to organize
the songs into various "sets", and give the title, artist, and year
or every song, we needed an announcer, and it's my voice doing the 
announcing, along with some computer-generated speech. We minimize the 
non-musical content, and shows are around 90% real oldies music, and 
10% announcer bumpers, jingles, commercials, and other
vintage soundbytes.  At any rate, you can stream a show
and know what you're hearing without having to look at a screen.
</p><p>
I came up with the week-of-the-year concept to partition shows by
the music that was on the charts a particular week of a month, but
across all ten years of the sixties.  For simplicity, I settled on
4 weeks per month, so in the end there will be 48 shows.  I 
would like to get all 3,000 songs from my collection into a show,
and at around 100 songs per show, that should work out with not too
many songs duplicated across shows.  (You don't want to know about
the horrible process of encoding iTunes tags for 3,000 songs so
that smart playlists can display the songs for a particular week). 
</p><p>
As far as each show's song organization, we use common radio groupings like
artist twin spins, triple-plays, survey countdowns, artist profile, 
one-hit-wonders,
"forgotten" oldies, etc., 
along with
recurring features like Movie Songs, Celebrity Spotlight (singers who
are also TV / movie actors), Look-What-They've-Done-To-My-Song (two or
more versions of the same song), "Answer" songs, Beatle Mania, King's
Korner (Elvis), Danze Kraze, Name Game, Girl Power, Psychedelic Cellar, and Way-Back
Machine visits to the Fifties, as well
as Mystery Themes and Cross-Country Road Trips.
Each show features two flashback countdowns from two years of the sixties, 
which begin with a bit of a recap of what the world was like in that
week in the news and culture.
</p><p>
As far as playback, each show is around 4 to 5 hours total length, and 
is split into 3 or 4 parts.  Gaps have been edited out, and the
volume normalized across tracks, so you get a pretty smooth, continous
flow of music, bumpers, and vintage artifacts. This is NOT a song-streaming 
service, and the only way to skip around is to use whatever 
your playback device and software supply.
</p><p>
We would love to get requests and suggestions as new shows are always 
being developed.
