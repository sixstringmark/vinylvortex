We are back in the 1st week of June, 1966, and about to get started on a cross-country
countdown road trip.  We'll be counting down the collective top ten from the surveys for this
week from ten stations in ten cities, as we travel eastward from Vancouver, Canada to New York City,
a trip of 3700 miles.

We're driving in a big, luxurious 1966 Chrysler Imperial Crown.  This is a virtual road
trip, but this really was my first car - spacious, beautiful silver-gray, power-everything, with
a big V8 engine, 4-wheel drum brakes, and a huge low-rise trunk, perfect for loading
equipment.  And one cool feature to amuse your friends - the vacuum-tube powered radio
had a push-button on the floor, above the headlight dimmer, that would auto-seek the next 
station.  Great fun to be cruising along with both hands on the wheel and watch your
passengers react when they see the radio dial moving and tuning all by itself.

We've got places to go and lots of good music to hear - lets rev it up and get out
of Canada and into the USA.  Pushing the button to listen to CFUN on the way out...
